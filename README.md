# mResilience
mResilience Product Website aimed to give First Responders a quick overview of the program and mobile app. 


mResilience Product Website Proposal

Idea: TIAG (client) has requested assistance on creating a product-focused website that provides information about mResilience program and services. 
Target Audience: first responders, first responder decision-makers and first responder leadership
Problem: Representative users (first responder community members) need a quick way to access information about the mResilience program and a way to connect with the mResilience team directly regarding additional questions or requesting a demo. 
Currently, TIAG does not have adequate digital presence to market this new program to first responder communities. To rectify this, TIAG has asked us (Group 2) to help create a website—using the design created by their staff—that provides information about the program and products they are looking to sell to first responder agencies. 
Goal: For users to have digital access to information about the mResilience program and a way to connect with mResilience representatives about a demo and/or further questions. 

User Stories:

As a user, I want to send a request to the mResilience team about my interest in their program. 
As a user, I want to ensure what I send is spelled correctly. (Spellcheck API)
As a user, I want to provide my email information so someone will contact me. (Email Validation API). 
As a user, I want to see current articles about police and wellness so I can get a snapshot of the challenges/needs for my first responders. (NYT article API, + one other)
As a user, I will see an animated indicator that tells me I have successfully submitted a request for more information. (in the form section using CSS animation library).
